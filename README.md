Customer Segmentation Analysis 👥📈

Corporate Segment Success: The Corporate customer segment saw the fastest growth in both profit and units sold, with a 30% year-over-year increase. This outpaced both the Home Office and Consumer segments, highlighting B2B partnerships as a key profit driver in 2015.
Segmented Growth: By segmenting customers, I uncovered that Corporate clients contributed significantly to both volume and high-margin sales, suggesting continued focus on this group could yield higher profitability.
Product Category Performance 💼🎯

Top-Performing Categories: Technology items, followed closely by Office Supplies, produced the highest profit margins. Furniture products grew at a slower pace but showed resilience in Q4, likely due to holiday season demand.
High-Demand Products: Popular items like laptops, office chairs, and storage solutions consistently sold well, contributing both volume and profit. These products represent core offerings that are essential to the company’s sales mix.
Visual Insights and Dashboard Highlights 🎨📈

To enhance the report's clarity and accessibility, I created interactive dashboards using bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps. These visuals highlight regional strengths, top-selling product trends, and customer segment performance, allowing for a quick and effective data exploration experience.
